Welcome to my Github Pages site! It contains some basic information about myself, my interests, my skill set, and some projects I've worked on.

Besides drinking copious amounts of coffee and planning weekend hikes, I am an avid **[R user](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}** and strong believer in reproducible workflows for research.

The journey up to this point has been non-linear. I completed my undergraduate studies in an [interdisciplinary field](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/biophysics/undergraduate/future_students/what_is_medical_biophysics.html){target="_blank"}, but shifted my interest to **public health** for my [graduate studies](https://www.bu.edu/sph/){target="_blank"} where I discovered [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) as an amazing tool for data analysis. I also found a passion for understanding how infectious diseases affect health at the population level. 

My current interests are in the epidemiology of infectious diseases and disease surveillance. I am also interested in the intersection of data science and public health - how data science tools can be used in the public health context, specifically for infectious disease research. I consider myself a **data science enthusiast** as I'm still building my [analytical skill set](cv.html).  

I currently work as an [epidemiogist](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/epidemiology-uninitiated/1-what-epidemiology){target="_blank"} in Toronto, Canada. If you want to connect or grab a coffee, feel free to [contact me](contact.html)!
