Welcome to my Github Pages site! It contains some basic information about myself, my interests, my skill set, and some projects I've worked on.

Besides drinking copious amounts of coffee and planning weekend hikes, I am an avid **[R user](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}** and strong believer in reproducible workflows for research.

The journey up to this point has been non-linear. I completed my undergraduate studies in an [interdisciplinary field](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/biophysics/undergraduate/future_students/what_is_medical_biophysics.html){target="_blank"}, but shifted my interest to **public health** for my [graduate studies](https://www.bu.edu/sph/){target="_blank"} where I discovered [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) as an amazing tool for data analysis.

I currently work as an [epidemiogist](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/epidemiology-uninitiated/1-what-epidemiology){target="_blank"} in Toronto, Canada. If you want to connect or grab a coffee, feel free to [contact me](contact.html)!
