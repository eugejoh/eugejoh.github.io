Welcome to my Github Page! This website contains information about myself, my interests and some projects I've worked on.

I consider myself to be a hybrid public health data professional with domain knowledge and expertise in disease surveillance and a technical skill set more closely aligned to a data scientist. Since completing my graduate studies I have over 6 years of experience working in various multidisciplinary research and public sector settings with increasing responsibilities. I have extensive experience working directly with surveillance information systems, strong data management and analytics skills.

I am an avid [**R user**](https://www.r-project.org/) currently work as an [epidemiologist](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/epidemiology-uninitiated/1-what-epidemiology){target="_blank"} in Ottawa, Canada. If you would like to connect, feel free to [contact me](contact.html).
