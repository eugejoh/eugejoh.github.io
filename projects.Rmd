This page contains some **data visualizations** on work I've done over the years using variety of R packages. Most of these are from [previous blog posts](https://opendatascience.com/user/eugene-joh/) demonstrating using R for data wrangling and visualization.

### Emergency Department Visit Diagnosis
This *tree map* was created using data from the [National Health Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/index.htm) from the United States. The groups are the diagnoses given for the emergency department visit, based on ICD-9 codes captured in the dataset.

*Created using the [treemap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treemap/index.html) package.*

### Refugees and Populations of Concern
The [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)](https://www.unhcr.org/data.html), the UN Refugee Agency obtain information of displaced persons from around the world, including refugees. The stacked bar chart displays the increase of these [Populations of Concern](https://www.unhcr.org/ph/persons-concern-unhcr) over time. Note that definitions of these groups were introduced at different time points but the overall number of displaced peoples have steadily increased.

*Created using the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package.*

### Seasonality of Watermain Breaks
The City of Toronto has an [open data portal](https://open.toronto.ca/) with datasets on watermain breaks throughout the city. The animated boxplots display the number of watermain breaks in each month over a 26 year period. The blue line represents the number of watermain breaks for a specific year.

*Created using the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) packages.*

### Laminar Flow in a Pipe
[Hagenâ€“Poiseuille's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_equation) describes the behaviour of an incompressible fluid in laminar flow within a cylindrical pipe with a constant radius. The animated visualization shows the changes in the velocity profile when the pressure difference increases, here at each time point (*t*).

*Created using the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) packages.*
